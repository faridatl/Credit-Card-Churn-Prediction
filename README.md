## Credit Card Churn Prediction:

  Objective: To employ supervised learning models in Python to assess and predict the likelihood of a credit card customer either staying or churning while also comparing these models to determine the best performance based in metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
  
  Skills Demonstrated: 
      Data Cleaning/Preprocessing: Checks for missing and duplicate values, removal of irrelevant columns/rowa, label encoding of binary categorical features, and the creation of dummy variables for non-binary categorical features to ensure optimal quality for predictive modeling.     
      EDA: Generating correlation graphs/maps, pie charts, histograms, and plots to explore and visualize the relationships between the features in the dataset.
      Machine learning: Implemented Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, SVM, and KNN algorithms to carry out predictions. Overall model accurscy, precison, and recall metrics were calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of each algorithm in prredicting whether a credit card customer would churn.
      Data Visualization: Utilized a confusion matrix for all algorithms used in order to provide a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. These offered valuable insight into each model's performsnce and aided in the assessment of predictive accuracy.
